## Cardiovascular Disease Prediction UI

This project involves developing a cardiovascular disease prediction model, which will be integrated into a React/Flask web application. The model analyzes user inputs to efficiently assess CVD risk.

This repository contains the frontend code with purely UI logic. The backend repository can be found [here](https://github.com/carrot2803/cvd-predictor) or in the About section.

## Site Availability

You can view the site at [Site Link](https://carrot2803.github.io/cvd-app)

## Features

-   Short cardiovascular disease (CVD) risk survey
-   AI-powered chat assistant for survey guidance and CVD insights
-   Personalized advice based on your risk factors and predicted CVD probability
-   Exploratory data analysis (EDA) to compare your metrics with population data
-   Responsive design optimized for mobile and other devices

## Usage

On accessing the CVD predictor website, users are presented with a short survey and an AI chatbot for guidance. After survey completion, the model provides a CVD risk prediction along with feedback based on identified risk factors. Recommendations are also offered, either reinforcing positive habits or advising against high-risk behaviors.

This serves as a baseline use case for how the CDC BRFSS dataset can be used to train machine learning models for disease detection. There are other more viable models that can be written
